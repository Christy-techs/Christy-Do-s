  - **`taskController.js`:** Functions for task-related operations (e.g., create, update, delete tasks).
  - **`userController.js`:** Functions for user-related operations (e.g., authentication, profile management).
  
- **`middlewares/`:** Middleware functions for authentication and error handling.
  - **`authMiddleware.js`:** Validates user authentication tokens.
  - **`errorHandler.js`:** Catches and formats errors.

- **`models/`:** Database models for MongoDB.
  - **`Task.js`:** Schema for storing tasks.
  - **`User.js`:** Schema for user profiles.

- **`routes/`:** Defines API routes.
  - **`taskRoutes.js`:** Routes for task-related actions.
  - **`userRoutes.js`:** Routes for user-related actions.

- **`services/`:** Contains reusable services for tasks like notifications.

- **`utils/`:** Utility functions such as database connection logic.

### **Frontend**
The frontend is developed using **React** for a dynamic and modern UI.

- **`public/`:** Contains static files (e.g., `index.html`).
- **`src/`:** Source files for the React application.
  - **`components/`:** Reusable React components like `Navbar` and `TaskCard`.
  - **`pages/`:** Page components for routing (e.g., `Home`, `Analytics`).
